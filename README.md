# Exploratory data analysis using GitHub and R 
_This is an MSc level course taught in the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/)_. This is my homework repository where I will keep my assignments in the folder hw'#number' (e.g., hw01 means homework 01).

## Introduction of myself 

Hi. I am Md. Belal Hossain (**Belal**). I am doing MSc in Population and Public Health under the [School of Population and Public Health](https://www.spph.ubc.ca/), the [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/), Canada. I have completed my Bachelor and MSc in Applied Statistics from the [University of Dhaka](https://www.isrt.ac.bd/), Bangladesh. I have worked for [BRAC](http://www.brac.net/) (the largest non-government organization in the world) and [BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health](http://sph.bracu.ac.bd/), [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/), Bangladesh for three years. I found both data analysis and data visualizations are very important tools and integral parts of public health research. I hope this Exploratory data analysis course will help me to boost my capabilities and will help me to think beyond statistics. As currently, I am also working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/), I hope this course will also help me to learn and apply data analysis tools and visualization techniques using GitHub and R. The following two things are particularly I want to learn from this course:
1. Appropriate data analysis techniques using R and GitHub
2. Efficient data visualization tools

The additional things that I want to learn are:
* Coding style
* Use of _tidyverse_ and _ggplot2_
* Generating reports efficiently
* Good control over GitHub and R
